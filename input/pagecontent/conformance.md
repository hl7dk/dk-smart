### Capability Statement

The [Danish SMART Server Capability Statement](CapabilityStatement-dk-smart-server.html) definition includes formal requirements for SMART servers in Denmark. In essence, it mandates support for REST API's and for JSON format, and recommends support for the [IPA](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/) specification and for XML format. The [Danish SMART Server Capability Statement Profile](StructureDefinition-dk-smart-server-profile.html) is intended to help in validation of server capability statements. It is expected that servers supporting SMART also serves FHIR resources that complies with those listed in [DK Core](https://hl7.dk/fhir/core) (where applicable).
