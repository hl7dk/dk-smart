### Capability Statement

The [Danish SMART Server Capability Statement](CapabilityStatement-dk-smart-server.html)
definition includes formal requirements for SMART servers in Denmark.

In essence, it mandates support for REST API's and for JSON format, and recommends support for the
IPA specification and for XML format.

The
[Danish SMART Server Capability Statement Profile](StructureDefinition-dk-smart-server-profile.html)
is intended to help in validation of server capability statements.
